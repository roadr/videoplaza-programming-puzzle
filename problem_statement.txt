Videoplaza programming puzzle

You are in charge of selling online video advertising at a large media company. Your job is to make sure that 

you make as much money as possible from ads running on your site. You are very good at what you do and 

can sell virtually an infinite amount of impressions (a display of an ad to a user) to a multitude of advertisers.

However, your boss isn't happy. He claims that you cannot show more than 3 ads before each video clip on 

the site, or no one will visit the site. Although you are very skeptical about this, you must do what your boss 

tells you. This upcoming month you therefore have a total ad inventory of 32 356 000 impressions available 

(meaning that you can display ads a maximum of 32 356 000 times).

To further complicate matters, you cannot sell an arbitrary number of impressions to a customer. Your 

customers buy impressions in chunks of different sizes called campaigns. For instance the advertiser Acme 

Inc. always buys campaigns of size 2 000 000 impressions that are to be delivered 

during one month. If you cannot deliver the full 2 000 000 impressions in time, Acme won't pay you. On the 

other hand, since you are such a good sales person, you are able to sell each customer an arbitrary amount 

of campaigns, as long as you can deliver all impressions in each campaign.

Your job will be to choose how many campaigns to sell to what customers in order to maximize the revenue.

For the upcoming month, your options are as follows:

Customers Impressions per campaign Revenue per campaign

Acme 2 000 000 200 €

Lorem 3 500 000 400 €

Ipsum 2 300 000 210 €

Dolor 8 000 000 730 €

SIT 10 000 000 1,000 €

Amet 1 500 000 160 €

Mauris 1 000 000 100 €

Since you are not only a good sales person, but also an excellent programmer, you decide to write a 

program that will help you find the best possible mix of campaigns. And since you hate repeating yourself, 

you make sure you write the program so you can re-use it next month as well.

Write a java program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, 

which contains the input data.
